## The Goblin Gardener's Tale
*A Short Fanfiction*

Grimble the goblin had never been like the others of his clan. While they spent their days hoarding shiny trinkets and setting elaborate traps for unwary travelers, Grimble preferred the quiet company of plants. His small cave at the edge of the Whispering Woods had become an unexpected oasis of greenery and fragrant blooms.

"Talking to flowers again, are we?" Nobble, his cousin, would tease whenever he passed by. "No self-respecting goblin cares for such useless things!"

But Grimble only smiled, his wrinkled green hands gently patting the soil around a newly planted moonberry bush. "These 'useless things' feed us, heal us, and ask for nothing in return," he would reply.

One spring morning, while Grimble was tending to his garden, a small tabby cat wandered into his garden. Most goblins would have chased it away or worse, but Grimble simply watched as the creature sniffed curiously at his prized nightshade.

"Careful there, little one," he cautioned, his voice gravelly but kind. "That one's not for eating."

To his surprise, the cat looked up at him, blinked slowly, and then proceeded to curl up in a patch of sunlight next to his gardening tools. From that day forward, the cat—whom Grimble named Whisker—became his constant companion.

Word spread through the forest of the peculiar goblin who grew flowers instead of stealing them, who befriended cats instead of scaring them. Gradually, woodland creatures began to visit his garden, and even a few brave human children would leave small tokens of appreciation at the edge of his property.

"You've gone soft," Nobble accused one day, glaring suspiciously at Whisker, who was purring contentedly on Grimble's lap.

Grimble just shrugged, his leathery face crinkling into a smile. "Perhaps. But my garden grows, my heart is light, and I've never slept better. Maybe being a goblin isn't just one thing, after all."

As the seasons changed and years passed, Grimble's garden became a sanctuary known throughout the land, proof that even a goblin could find joy in creating beauty rather than mischief—though he did still enjoy the occasional harmless prank, just to keep up appearances.
